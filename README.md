# ANSIO

A zig library to manipulate the terminal, primarily through the use of ANSI escape codes.
This is primarily a place for me to experiment with how ANSI escape codes work, if you want to use a reliable/stable/correct library don't use this.

## TODO

- [x] Keyboard events
- [x] Resize event and terminal size
- [x] Raw mode
- [ ] Colors
- [ ] Image Protocols?
